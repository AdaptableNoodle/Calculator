# Calculator
On-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

1. Your calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators, so start by creating functions for the following items and testing them in your browser’s console.
add
subtract
multiply
divide

2. Create a new function operate that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.

3. Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons… you should be storing the ‘display value’ in a variable somewhere for use in the next step.
